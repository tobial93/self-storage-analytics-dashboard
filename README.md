## 📊 Project Overview: Self-Storage Analytics SaaS
This project is a comprehensive operational dashboard designed to transform raw self-storage facility data into actionable management insights. It bridges the gap between fragmented data sources and executive decision-making.

### 🛠️ The Challenge
Managing multi-unit storage facilities requires real-time visibility into occupancy rates, payment churn, and seasonal demand. This SaaS solution automates the data collection and visualization process, replacing manual spreadsheets with a high-performance analytics layer.

### 🚀 Key Engineering Features
- **End-to-End Pipeline:** Automated ETL workflows to ingest and clean facility data.
- **Operational KPIs:** Real-time tracking of Net Effective Rent (NER), occupancy trends, and delinquency rates.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed with a modular approach to support multi-tenant data structures.
- **Interactive UX:** Custom-built visualizations that allow managers to drill down from regional overviews to individual unit performance.

**Tech Stack:** Python, SQL, [Insert Dashboard Tool, e.g., Power BI/Streamlit], [Insert Database].
